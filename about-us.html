			<p>"Ye old bookshop” is a bookshop run by Julia. It's specialize in valuable old books mainly 1st editions. The bookstore’s main business is buying and selling old books and it also offers book restoration and valuation. As our client’s describing the bookstore has friendly customer service, diligent researchers, qualified librarians and fast/timely service.  </p>
			
			<p>Our  shop is a huge 500 sq. metre space, where we stock a large range of book titles which complement our text book market. We also stock an extensive range of stationery, as well as magazines and greeting cards. We have many loyal customers from outside of the University precincts, who have discovered the joy of shopping in a non-mall atmosphere. Car parking is situated beside the store.</p>

			<p>Our speciality is making small numbers of fine hard-covered books and the repairing/restoring of damaged books. This includes foil stamping and blind embossing (actually debossing - but embossing is what most people seem to call it!). We do much more than this; we also have the expertise to manufacture soft-covered volumes, all sorts of special folders - from ring binders to brass-post binders, and numerous styles of protective and display boxes. So our work covers everything from thesis binding to special menu covers, and from one-off product display boxes to library binding.</p>
